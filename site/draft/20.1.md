If you open a terminal and look at the prompt, the command prompt will look like userName@machineName:~$ . That is fine in normal circumstances. But if you intend to take screen shots of your screen and/or terminal, you might not want to show the prompt that way (at least that was my use case). I have seen individuals take screen shot and then use image editors to blur the prompt. But why, there is an easier way.

	PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\w\$ '  

Now, the prompt will just show the folder path followed by $ . If you want the prompt to be something else other than $ , you can edit accordingly. For eg: Following will make the prompt be >> instead of $  

	PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\w >> '  

![Terminal](img/20.1.1.png "Terminal")  

If you want to make sure that every time a terminal is opened, the new prompt show up (and the default prompt of userName@machineName:~$ never show up), you can edit .bashrc . This will be in your user home directory (where ever `cd ~ ` takes you). Look for for the line were PS1 get assigned to. The string ` \u@\h: ` is responsible for showing the user name and machine name in terminal prompt. Replace the whole line with the code above or delete \u@\h: and you are in business.  

You can either close the terminal and reopen the terminal after saving the change to .bashrc or type ` . ~/.bashrc ` in the same terminal to see the changes take effect.
