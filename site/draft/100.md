Open the the source file and destination files using two vim editors. Set ``` clipboard ``` to unnamed in both vim edirots. While the custor is inside the vim editor and it is in command mode (press esc before you type this if you are not sure which mode the editor is in)  

	:set clipboard=unnamed  


In the source vim editor (where the source from which you are copying is open); press esc key 
Esc is pressed just to make sure that the mode is chaged to command mode (while using vim; when in doubt press esc :-) )
Positon the cusor at the beginning of the line that need to be copied  

	press v key  
	use down arrow or j key to move the cursor down and highlight the lines to copy
	press y key once the lines to be copied are highlighted  
  

Now, those lines (yanked lines as they are called) are in the clipboard. Move over to the destination vim editor (where the file to which you want the selected content is open) . Position the cursor where you want the content to be pasted.  

	Press p

There you got it. The conten from the clipboard is in your file. Not bad eh ..
