I often come across the need to find a specific string inside files in folders recursively. Here are a few variations of `grep` , I have ended up using to accomplish that.  

List out the file names containing a string/word in the current directory and below
	
	grep -ilr [word]   

List out files names containing a string in the current folder or below where file name matches a specific pattern  

	grep -ilr linux --include "*.md"  

This will list out all the markdown (.md) files that has a string linux in it  

![grep list output](img/20.2.1.png "grep list output")  

List out files names containing a string in the current folder or below where file name does not match a specific pattern  

	grep -ilr linux --exclude "*.html"  

List out files and line number were the matching string occur inside files  

	grep -inr linux  

Any of these commands can be run from with a path parameter so that the search happens from within a specific folder  

	grep -ilr linux ~/projects/nodelab/site  

These are the grep parameters I end up using frequently ...
