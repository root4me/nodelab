Marketing documentation from Diatone states "One-piece nylon construction for durability." . Do not underestimate the importance of that statement because of two reasons

1.  One-piece construction seem to reduce the effect of vibrations. First quadcopter build i did, I spent insane amount of time chasing after reducing vibration (balancing motors, experimenting with flightcontroller mount etc.). 
One of the challenges had been the fact that multi piece construction was making it unpredictable how the flight controller gets affected by the vibrations transmitted from the arms to rest of the frame that hold them together.
2.  This frame is definitly durable and can surivive some nasty crashes. It is not brittle and will not break easily.

> You will crash when when you are learning and even after you get a good handle of it. So, be prepared.
