I have been using ubuntu as my primary operating system at home for over a year now. Till then, it was an on and off relationship with linux, mostly by spinning up VM and trying out different distros of linux.  

One day, I decided that VM is too slow and I must partition the disk in my laptop and make it dual boot into ubuntu.Thought process was, I can assess if I will end up booting into ubuntu more or windows. Well, it is safe to say that I ended up booting into ubuntu all the time. I have almost forgotten that this laptop can be booted into windows. Earlier this year, I bought a new laptop and I ended up promptly installing Ubuntu on it.  

That being said, I am still not an expert with the OS and find myself googling for commands and how to do things. Through these pages, I am going to write down some of the things I have learned and some others I do not want to forget.
