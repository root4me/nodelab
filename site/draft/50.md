Trivial thing for openCV experts. But it took some googling along with some trial and error to figure it out. Hence writing it down.

cmake parameters will look something like the following

```
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D WITH_TBB=ON BUILD_TBB=ON ..
```

Followed by a ```make``` and ```sudo make install``` of course.
