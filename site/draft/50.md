BeagleBoneBlack is so easy to set up once you unpack it from the box. I bought one back in  2013 and then I prompty digressed into learning node.js (triggered by the fact that the device showcases samples using bonescript as soon as you plug it in). I do not regret learning node.js. It was a lot of fun and gave me an opportunity to smirk and tell a few professional developers why java script is not all that bad as they think and 'oh..wait .. it works outsde the browser'. Once that phase was over,  I decided that it is time I follow my desire to build a multicoptor. That can not be left as unfinished business now, can it ?
All this while, my BeagleBoneBlack sat on my desk with puppy eyes waiting for some attention. Oh so sad ! So, I decided to start on a beagle bone project :)

These pages represent some of the things I learned as i went along tinkering with BBB ...
