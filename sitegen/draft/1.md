Number of crashes, broken frames, attempts at tuning the motors, flight controller and a lot of frustrations later; 
i decided that the first quadcopter I tried to build was not going to get me to the point of taking stable videos form the sky with out some 
serious rework. I did some research (Google and read what others have written is now a days called research) and decided to 
build a mini quadcopter (smaller frame) with an entirely new flight controller. I am glad i made that call since this machine worked like a 
charm right from it's maiden test flight, taught me how to fly and still keep me hooked to flying. I am still a beginner and i have still a 
lot to learn, but I am convinced, this is hands down one of the best configuration for a beginner to this hobby and will make your entry in 
to this world a lot of fun.
