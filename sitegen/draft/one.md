Number of crashes, broken frames, attempts at tuning the motors, flight controller and a lot of frustrations later; 
i decided that the first quadcopter I tried to build was not going to get me to the point of taking stable videos form the sky with out some 
serious rework. I did some research (Google and read what others have written is now a days called research) and decided to 
build a mini quadcopter (smaller frame) with an entirely new flight controller. I am glad i made that call since this machine worked like a 
charm right from it's maiden test flight, taught me how to fly and still keep me hooked to flying. I am still a beginner and i have still a 
lot to learn, but I am convinced, this is hands down one of the best configuration for a beginner to this hobby and will make your entry in 
to this world a lot of fun.

#### Why choose this frame
Marketing documentation from Diatone states "One-piece nylon construction for durability." . Do not underestimate the importance of that statement because of two reasons

1.  One-piece construction seem to reduce the effect of vibrations. First quadcopter build i did, I spent insane amount of time chasing after reducing vibration (balancing motors, experimenting with flightcontroller mount etc.). 
One of the challenges had been the fact that multi piece construction was making it unpredictable how the flight controller gets affected by the vibrations transmitted from the arms to rest of the frame that hold them together.
2.  This frame is definitly durable and can surivive some nasty crashes. It is not brittle and will not break easily.

> You will crash when when you are learning and even after you get a good handle of it. So, be prepared.
